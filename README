How to build cross-tools
------------------------

You need to make sure you have all the right development tools installed.

This command will probably do the right thing on debian/ubuntu:
  apt-get install gcc g++ make flex bison patch yasm wget

This  command will probably do the right thing on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
  yum install gcc gcc-c++ make flex bison path yasm wget

Stand in the top level directory and run the build script
with the command:
  ./cross-tools/build-script.sh

The script will download all the necessary source packages.
All being well, it will install everything into the cross-tools directory.

cross-tools/mingw-w64-i686:   cross compiler for 32bit Windows
cross-tools/mingw-w64-x86_64: cross compiler for 64bit Windows



How to build depkgs
-------------------

This how-to assumes that you have already installed burp-cross-tools.

You also need to get a copy of the VSS header files. See README.VSS.
Additionally, 'cmake' is needed.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run:
  apt-get install cmake

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, you can run:
  yum install cmake

Furthermore, autoconf and libtool are needed.


On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run:
  apt-get install autoconf libtool

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, you can run:
  yum install autoconf libtool libstdc++-static unzip

Once done, stand in the top level directory and run the build-script with the
command:
  ./depkgs/build-script.sh

All being well, it will install everything into the depkgs directory.

  depkgs/mingw-w64-i686:   dependencies for 32-bit Windows
  depkgs/mingw-w64-x86_64: dependencies for 64-bit Windows



How to build everything at once
-------------------------------

Install all the requirements above.

Stand in the top level directory and run the top level build-script with the
command:
  ./build-script.sh

This will run the build-script for cross-tools and depkgs in turn.
