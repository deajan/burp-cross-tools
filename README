How to build everything
-----------------------

You will need to get a copy of the VSS header files. See README.VSS.

Install docker.
Copy vss.tar.gz to depkgs/source.
Then:
  docker build -t burp-cross-tools .

This will build everything for you, and leave you with a docker image that
you can use to cross compile burp for Windows.
