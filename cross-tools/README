How to build burp-cross-tools
-----------------------------

You need to make sure you have all the right development tools installed.

This command will probably do the right thing on debian/ubuntu:
  apt-get install gcc g++ make flex bison patch yasm wget

This  command will probably do the right thing on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
  yum install gcc gcc-c++ make flex bison path yasm wget

Stand in the top level directory and run the build script
with the command:
  ./build-script

The script will download all the necessary source packages.
All being well, it will install everything into the top level directory.
