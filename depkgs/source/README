How to build burp-depkgs
------------------------

This how-to assumes that you have already installed burp-cross-tools.

You also need to get a copy of the VSS header files. See README.VSS.
Additionally, 'cmake' is needed.

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run:
  apt-get install cmake

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, you can run:
  yum install cmake

Furthermore, autoconf and libtool are needed.


On Debian/Ubuntu, you can run:
  apt-get install autoconf libtool

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, you can run:
  yum install autoconf libtool libstdc++-static unzip

Once all that is done, stand in the 'src' directory and run build-script
with the command:
  ./build-script

All being well, it will install everything into the top level directory.
